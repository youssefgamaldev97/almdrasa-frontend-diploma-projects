# Practical Projects with Python + ChatGPT

## Overview

Understanding the fundamental concepts of programming and their purpose is just as important as knowing how to write code. New programmers need to learn how to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This series of training videos explains core programming concepts by connecting them to small, real-world projects.

## Course Objectives

In this course, we will create six key projects that link what you’ve learned in the foundational and intermediate programming courses to real-world applications. Additionally, we’ll focus on enhancing code quality using artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.

## What You'll Learn

- Core Programming Concepts: Build a strong foundation by connecting theory to real-world examples.
- Practical Problem-Solving: Develop projects that solve realistic challenges using Python.
- AI-Powered Code Optimization: Learn how to use AI tools to improve and refine your code.

This course is perfect for learners who want to reinforce their understanding of Python and take their coding skills to the next level.
